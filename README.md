1. Why did you build this project?

I build this project to learn how to use HTML CSS and Javascript together to make a game/quiz.
These where the criteria givin to me.

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

2. What problem does it solve?

I solved how to use a timer at the start of the game to give users a time limit for the quiz.
I stored data with local storage and used that data in different HTML pages. I was able to get the correct answers by using data-number in the HTML.

3. What did I learn?

I learned how to get data from an array of objects with a foreach meathod. I learned how to show and hide css class in Javascript. I learned how to store data in local storage. I learned how to use setInterval() for the timer.
